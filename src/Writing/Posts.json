Mostly, the confusion lies around the mistaken belief of the process being long and complicated. For that reason, many people opt instead to deploy via third-party hosting platforms like GitHub Pages, Firebase Hosting, or Heroku. While these are all great free options that I’ve used in the past, I’m happy to tell you that you can actually have your React application online within five minutes on your own personal domain. "
